# PLC Project Silo Simulator

## Introduction

The PLC Project Silo Simulator is a simulated environment designed to mimic the functionality of a silo control system. This project aims to provide a platform for testing and developing PLC programs for controlling silo operations, such as filling, emptying, and monitoring levels.

## Features

### 1. Silo Model

- Simulated silo with configurable parameter different modes.
- Real-time visualization of silo level and status.

### 2. PLC Emulation

- Emulation of a PLC system with support for ladder logic programming.
- Ability to create, edit, and upload PLC programs to control silo operations.
